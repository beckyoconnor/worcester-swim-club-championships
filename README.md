## Component 1: Swim Event Extractor

Extracts and cleans swimming event data from MeetManager .RES text files.

### Features

- ‚úÖ Parses MeetManager .RES format files
- ‚úÖ Extracts swimmer data: Name, Age, Club, Time, WA Points
- ‚úÖ Validates all data with strict rules (no NaN values)
- ‚úÖ Removes duplicate entries automatically
- ‚úÖ Categorizes events (Sprint, Free, 100 Form, 200 Form, IM, Distance)
- ‚úÖ Determines gender from event names
- ‚úÖ Creates individual CSV files per event

### Usage

#### Command Line

Extract all .RES files from a folder:

```bash
python swim_event_extractor.py --res-dir WSC_Club_Champs_2025/raw_files
```

Specify custom output directory:

```bash
python swim_event_extractor.py --res-dir WSC_Club_Champs_2025/raw_files --output-dir ./output
```

#### As a Python Library

```python
from swim_event_extractor import SwimEventExtractor

# Create extractor instance
extractor = SwimEventExtractor(output_dir='WSC_Club_Champs_2025')

# Extract all events from .RES files
results = extractor.extract_all_events_from_res('WSC_Club_Champs_2025/raw_files')

# Results show number of swimmers per event
for event_num, swimmer_count in results.items():
    print(f"Event {event_num}: {swimmer_count} swimmers")
```

### Input Format

The extractor expects MeetManager .RES files with this format:

```
EVENT 302 Open/Male 400m Freestyle

Place    Name                Age  Club    Time        WA Points
1.       Lucy PIPER          12   WORM    6:04.09     359
2.       James WALTER        11   WORM    6:15.23     340
```

### Output Format

Creates CSV files in `cleaned_files/` subfolder:

**File:** `event_302.csv`

| Event Number | Event Name | Event Category | Gender | Name | Age | Club | Time | WA Points |
|--------------|------------|----------------|--------|------|-----|------|------|-----------|

python club_championships_scoreboard.py
```

#### Configuration

Edit the `main()` function in the script:

```python
def main():
    # Set your championship folder
    base_folder = 'WSC_Club_Champs_2025'
    
    # Script will automatically:
    # - Read from: base_folder/cleaned_files/*.csv
    # - Write to: base_folder/championship_results/
```

#### As a Python Library

```python
from club_championships_scoreboard import (
    load_all_events,
    get_event_gender_map_from_csvs,
    calculate_championship_scores,
    create_age_groups,
    export_scoreboard
)

# Load event data
df_all = load_all_events('WSC_Club_Champs_2025')

# Get gender mapping
event_gender_map = get_event_gender_map_from_csvs('WSC_Club_Champs_2025')

# Calculate scores
df_champs = calculate_championship_scores(df_all, event_gender_map)

# Create age groups
df_champs = create_age_groups(df_champs)

# Export results
export_scoreboard(df_champs, 'WSC_Club_Champs_2025')
```

### Output Files

The script creates files in `championship_results/` subfolder:

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. No CSV files found

**Problem**: `No CSV files found in cleaned_files`

**Solution**: Run the event extractor first:
```bash
python swim_event_extractor.py --res-dir WSC_Club_Champs_2025/raw_files --output-dir WSC_Club_Champs_2025
```

#### 2. Module not found errors

**Problem**: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pandas'`

**Solution**: Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### 3. Dashboard doesn't load data

**Problem**: Dashboard shows "No data available"

**Solution**: Ensure you've run the scoreboard calculator:
```bash
python club_championships_scoreboard.py
```

#### 4. Memory issues on Streamlit Cloud

**Problem**: Dashboard crashes or runs slowly

**Solution**: The dashboard is optimized for Streamlit Community Cloud (2GB limit):
- Uses Parquet files for efficient loading
- Implements caching
- Uses category data types for memory optimization
- Monitor memory usage in System Information expander

#### 5. Gender mapping issues

**Problem**: Events show as "Unknown" gender

**Solution**: Ensure event names contain gender indicators:
- "Male", "Open", "Open/Male" ‚Üí Male/Open
- "Female" ‚Üí Female

Check event names in your .RES files or CSV Event Name column.
