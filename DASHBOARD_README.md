- Calculations are cached for faster filtering

### Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- streamlit
- pandas
- openpyxl

## Troubleshooting

### Dashboard won't start
1. Ensure you're in the correct directory
2. Check that all required files exist:
   - `WSC Club Champs 2024.xlsx`
   - `WSC_Club_Champs_2024/cleaned_files/` folder with event CSVs

### Port already in use
If port 8501 is already in use:
```bash
streamlit run championship_dashboard.py --server.port 8502
```

### Clear cache
